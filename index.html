    <p>This is a recipe for peanut-sweet potato croquettes, adapted from George Washington Carver's <a href="https://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plantanswers/recipes/peanutrecipes.html"> Recipe No. 38 here</a>. Instead of spreading a peanut-based slurry on solid sweet potato slices, I puree the ingredients together into a single croquette. I suggest frying the ingredients in ghee instead of oil, though if you chose oil I suggest peanut oil or sunflower oil. I also replace salt and pepper with seaweed-based ingredients, bread crumbs with panko, the latter of which was partially replaced in turn by peanut flour</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>150 g roasted, unsalted peanuts</li>
      <li>1 sweet potato, chopped and boiled</li>
      <li>10 g kelp powder</li>
      <li>Pinch dulse granules (salt substitute)</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>40 g panko</li>
      <li>25 g peanut flour</li>
      <li>Ghee for frying</li>
    </ul>
<p>For the seaweed ingredients, I get mine <a href="https://seaveg.com"> from Maine Coast Sea Vegetables</a>
  For the peanut flour, it is a byproduct of <a href="https://www.nationalpeanutboard.org/news/diy-peanut-milk.htm">this peanut milk recipe from the National Peanut Board</a></p>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Gather dry ingredients and place them in a food processor. Put thin layer of paper towels on a large plate for later.
<li>Blanch peanuts until oily, then drain, about five minutes. Meanwhile, boil sweet potatoes until soft, about 10 minutes, then drain.</li>
<li>Put cooked ingredients in food processor. Also crack an egg and put it too in the food processor. Meanwhile, heat up ghee in pan on high.</li>
<li>Turn on food processor and blend until largely smooth and moderately sticky.</li>
<li>Form mixture into patties and fry in hot ghee until golden brown and firm.</li>
<li>Remove from heat and sop up excess oiliness by sitting on paper towels.</li>
  <li>Serve hot.</li>
  </ol>
